Transformation Logic

Construction Code Mapping: The raw data 8 uses terms like "Wood", "Masonry", "Steel", and 
"RCC". We map these to standard Construction Class Codes.


● Wood  Code 1 (Frame): Typically wood frame construction, vulnerable to wind 
(roof uplift) and fire, but relatively resilient to earthquake due to flexibility. 
● Masonry  RMS Code 2 (Joisted Masonry): Brick, concrete block, or stone. Rigid and 
brittle; highly vulnerable to earthquakes (if unreinforced) but moderately resistant to 
wind.

● Steel  Code 4 (Non-Combustible/Steel): Steel frame with non-combustible 
walls. High ductility makes it resilient to earthquakes. 
● RCC  RMS Code 6 (Fire Resistive / Reinforced Concrete): Reinforced concrete 
frame and floors. The most robust class, offering high resistance to both wind and 
earthquake forces.

Occupancy Code Mapping: Similarly, we map occupancy_type to RMS Occupancy Codes. 
These codes determine the vulnerability of the building's contents and potential for business 
interruption.

● Residential  Code 301 (Single Family Dwelling): Generally smaller structures, 
wood frame dominance.

● Commercial  Code 311 (General Commercial): Retail, offices.

● Industrial  Code 321 (General Industrial): Manufacturing, high contents value, 
complex vulnerability.


Architectural Note: We export to Parquet. Parquet is a columnar storage format that is 
highly efficient for the types of aggregate queries used in catastrophe modeling.
