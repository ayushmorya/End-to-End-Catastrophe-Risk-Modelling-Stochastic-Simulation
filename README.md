# 📌 End-to-End Catastrophe Risk Modelling Platform

### *(Moody’s RMS Workflow Replica using AWS + PySpark + Python)*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an enterprise-grade replication of the **Moody’s RMS Catastrophe Risk Modeling Workflow**, built using open-source technologies to simulate real-world insurance risk analytics pipelines.

Catastrophe (CAT) modeling is widely used by:

* Insurance Companies
* Reinsurance Firms
* Risk Engineering Teams
* Capital Market Investors (ILS / CAT Bonds)

to estimate financial losses caused by natural disasters such as:

* 🌪 Hurricanes
* 🌍 Earthquakes
* 🌊 Floods
* 🔥 Wildfires

This project demonstrates the complete:

```
Exposure → Hazard → Vulnerability → Financial Loss
```

modelling pipeline using:

* AWS Glue (PySpark ETL)
* Amazon S3 Data Lake
* Python Stochastic Simulation Engine
* Portfolio Loss Modeling
* AAL & EP Curve Calculation
* Catastrophe Bond Risk Transfer Simulation

The objective is to convert messy raw exposure datasets into meaningful insurance risk metrics such as:

✔ Average Annual Loss (AAL)
✔ Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP)
✔ Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
✔ Catastrophe Bond Expected Loss (EL)

## 🧠 Industry Framework Used – Four Box CAT Model

This platform replicates the industry-standard catastrophe modeling architecture:

| Module        | Description                        | Output                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hazard        | Simulates disaster intensity       | Wind Speed / Ground Motion |
| Exposure      | Assets exposed to catastrophe risk | EDM Schema                 |
| Vulnerability | Damage estimation from hazard      | Mean Damage Ratio (MDR)    |
| Financial     | Policy loss calculation            | GU Loss / Gross Loss       |

## 🏗 Data Engineering Layer (AWS)

### 🔹 S3 Lakehouse Architecture

| Layer  | Description           |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Bronze | Raw Exposure Data     |
| Silver | Cleaned Data          |
| Gold   | EDM Standardized Data |

### 🔹 Raw Inputs

* `location_raw.csv`
* `policy_raw.csv`

### 🔹 ETL using AWS Glue + PySpark

Performed:

* Schema Casting
* Data Quality Validation
* Geolocation Checks
* TIV Cleansing
* Construction Code Mapping
* Occupancy Code Mapping
* Financial Policy Join

Mapped to RMS-standardized:

* Construction Codes
* Occupancy Codes
* Policy Deductibles
* Policy Limits

Final EDM stored in:

```
s3://cat-mod-resume-project/curated/edm/
```

in Parquet format for optimized analytics performance.

## ⚙️ Modeling Engine (Python)

### 📍 Module 1 – Hazard Engine

* Generates Stochastic Event Set (SES)
* Simulates Hurricane Events
* Uses probabilistic event frequency
* Wind intensity simulated using:

  * Gamma / Normal Distribution

Produces:

✔ Hazard Intensity per Location

---

### 📍 Module 2 – Vulnerability Engine

Converts:

```
Hazard Intensity → Physical Damage
```

Damage Metric:

```
Mean Damage Ratio (MDR)
```

Based on:

* Construction Type
* Occupancy
* Hazard Intensity
* Year Built (Secondary Modifier)

Post-2000 Buildings:

✔ Receive Vulnerability Credit
✔ Reduced Structural Damage

---

### 📍 Module 3 – Financial Engine

Loss Waterfall Applied:

1️⃣ Ground Up Loss (GU)

```
GU Loss = TIV × MDR
```

2️⃣ Deductible Applied
3️⃣ Policy Limit Applied
4️⃣ Coinsurance Applied

Final Output:

```
Gross Loss (GR)
```

Stored as:

✔ Event Loss Table (ELT)

---

## 📊 Portfolio Risk Metrics

### 🔹 Average Annual Loss (AAL)

Expected yearly portfolio loss:

```
AAL = Σ(Event Loss × Annual Rate)
```

---

### 🔹 EP Curve (Occurrence Exceedance Probability)

Shows probability that loss exceeds threshold **L**.

Used for:

✔ Capital Planning
✔ Reinsurance Purchase
✔ Risk Appetite Decisions

Example Interpretation:

> There is a 1% probability that the annual portfolio loss will exceed the 100-Year PML.

| Parameter  | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Attachment | $100M |
| Exhaustion | $200M |
| Principal  | $100M |

Calculated:

✔ Bond Payout
✔ Expected Loss (EL)

## 🧪 Business Simulation – Portfolio Roll-Up

Simulated Renewal Season Scenario:

New Account Added:

```
ACC_FL_CONDO (Miami Portfolio)
```

| Metric          | Before | After |
| --------------- | ------ | ----- |
| 100-Year PML    | $85M   | $92M  |
| Marginal Impact | +$7M   |       |

Business Insight:

➡ Highly correlated peak catastrophe risk
➡ Requires capital adjustment
➡ May need facultative reinsurance
